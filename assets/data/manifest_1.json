      "description": "One of the most acclaimed shorts of recent memory—a 2020 Oscar nominee, and a Shorts Award Winner. Mohamed is a shepherd in rural Tunisia with his wife and two young sons. Their world is shaken when the oldest son returns after a long journey with a mysterious woman he says is his wife. \n\nA selection of Short of the Week, the web's leading curators of quality short films.\n\nSUBMIT A FILM: https://www.shortoftheweek.com/submit/\nFULL REVIEW: https://www.shortoftheweek.com/2019/10/02/ikhwene-brotherhood/\n\nBROTHERHOOD (Ikhwène)\nWritten and Directed by Meryam Joobeur\nMidi La Nuit, Cinetelefilms, Travelling Distribution\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BrotherhoodShortFilm/\n\nSubscribe to S/W on YouTube!\nWebsite: http://www.shortoftheweek.com\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ShortoftheWeek\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/shortoftheweek\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/shortoftheweek\n\n\"I do not fault the detractors and skeptics who proclaim that \"Brotherhood\" should be dismissed as merely representing this year’s archetypal festival drama—a pejorative term to some that indicates the kind of serious short film that confuses dourness with profundity, and is best understood as some young director’s try-hard bid to get their government film board to pony up for their feature debut. Let’s review the case: set in a locale exotic to the majority of elite fest-going cinephiles? Check. Tense and explosive family dynamics? Check. Gorgeous, yet restrained, cinematography? Check. Oh, and a sometimes languorous 25min runtime? Double-check! As a defense however to those critics and haters—watch the film. You’re wrong. Watch the film again.\n\nWhile \"Brotherhood\" exhibits the trappings of a type of film that we often deride as “festivally”, it is really hard in my mind to contest its exquisiteness. It is highly specific in its character and world-building, buoyed by the authenticity of its writer/director, Meryam Joobeur, whom is of Tunisian descent, and by the capable performances of its first-time actors (their casting, central to conception of the film, is recounted here). As pure drama, the film delivers, inculcating mystery early on, then building to a devastatingly emotional climax. Finally, in theme, it pulls off the nice trick of being both topical and timeless: confronting complex contemporary issues, like religious extremism, with the tried and true spirit of a Greek tragedy. \n\nFilmmakers have made hay for generations in porting the classics to film, from works as different as Laurence Olivier’s seminal Shakespeare adaptations to Clueless. Brotherhood is not an adaptation, but it is working with the same raw materials as Sophocles and Seneca—the defiance of one’s father, questions of honor, the inability to communicate with loved ones through the haze of anger, and, ultimately, betrayal...\n\n...

      "description": "WATCH MY NEW SHORT FILM \"A DREAM AWAY\" HERE: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/Kepm4H3Mqdg\n\nAfter all the waiting we have finally managed to finish our first ever short movie! A result of a collaboration between two photographers that have never done film, a wannabe actor who has never stood in front of a camera, and a random idea that two best friends had during the Corona lockdown. \n\nEveryone knows what it is like to have a bad day. We all catch ourselves way too often thinking \"Today sucks\" or \"Why me\". And we all probably know that most of the time the only thing we need to do to feel better is to take a few deep breaths to reset our mind and to calm down. Way too often we get tangled inside our own thoughts and emotions instead of taking a step back to think. But what if you had a really bad day? Have you ever managed to miss four busses in a row? This is the story of Mr. Kurz, our main character. A stressed businessman on the way to work who goes through hell in any way you can imagine. A choleric workaholic with a guidebook for mindfulness, trying to stay calm on probably his worst day ever.\n\n\nIn April 2020 I was living at Leo's house to \"study\" for our high school finals. This time instead ended up being one of the most creative and uniting time for us as a team. We were going for a run when we passed by this bus stop, seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Extremely inspired we started talking about a possible story and soon realized that this was an idea for a movie we really wanted to see. We wrote down the story and started drawing a storyboard. Maximilian Vogel, a friend, and professional storyboard artist, who has already worked for Netflix and others, always helped us to deconstruct our story and pushed us to think further. We teamed up with my friend and photographer Quentin Pehlke who soon brought Robin Buckenberger into our team. We started a collaboration with Lichtblick Konstanz, who supported us with a lot of equipment that we did not own. \nWe went through a lot of ups and downs throughout the process but it was one of the most fun projects ever. A lot of exhaustion and frustration and a lot of learning. The final result is different than expected but we are more than happy about this experience. \n\nProduced and edited by me (Moritz Högemann / momaln)\n\nStarring:\n\nLeo Rüland (Main Character)\nArthur Blank (Jogger)\nAnne Reinicke (Young Mother)\nRoman Schenk (Young Boy)\nLennard Schenk (Drunk Shooter)\nRobin Buckenberger (Teenager with Hookah)\nLuana Liebetrau (Unlucky Lady)\nLora Angelova (Teens in Car)\nPaula Chico (Teens in Car)\nQuentin Pehlke (Teens in Car)\nMoritz Högemann (Teens in Car)\n\nSUPPORTED BY LICHTBLICK KONSTANZ\n\nBig Thanks to all of our families and friends for the support!!\n\n\nA lot more stuff is coming soon on this channel! I have been inactive for far too long but I am more than ready to get started and cool videos are coming soon! (You can probably guess the kind of content from my new channel banner?) :D",

      "description": "☕ Coffee Is Important by Graeme Achurch & Nathan Hare\n\nDirector: Graeme Achurch\nWritten By: Graeme Achurch & Nathan Hare\nCast: Nathan Hare, Graeme Achurch, Danika Thibault\nDirector of Photography: Derek Janzen\nProduced By: Comedy Here Often?\nExecutive Produced By: Jonathan Simkin\nProducer: Steve Sidi\nOriginal Music: Kevvy Maher\nEditor: Graeme Achurch\n\nA pair of long lost friends re-discover the power of friendship, the quaint traditions of a small town, and the importance of coffee. Graeme Achurch and Nathan Hare write and perform in “Coffee is Important,” an extreme satire on the tropes of a sitcom, specifically poking fun at an archetypical small town friendship. With an offset amount of enthusiasm, Nathan eagerly introduces us to his coffee shop. It’s interrupted by the slow motion entrance of a seemingly cool man wearing sunglasses and a leather jacket. Believe it or not, it’s Nathan’s long-time friend Graeme. The two haven’t seen each other since Graeme left their “small town” for the big city where he’s now a hot-shot playwright. The film ridiculously tackles a number of familiar commercial television arcs: the two confront the possible shut down of Nathan’s coffee shop, Graeme puts up with his relentless agent, a miraculous body switch occurs, and their fractured relationship is revealed in Graeme’s new script. The over-the-top performances are amusing and disconcerting in moments where the parody is absurdly accentuated. -JM.\n\nGraeme Achurch https://www.instagram.com/graemeachurch/\nNathan Hare https://www.instagram.com/nathanhare/\nMore Soda Fountain content: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdJdPfMAAXyweFwSSl07rfHKdHRMHuARe\n\nSubscribe to our channel here: https://smarturl.it/comedyhereoften\n\nFOLLOW Comedy Here Often?:\nfacebook.com/ComedyHereOften\ninstagram.com/comedyhereoften | @comedyhereoften\ntwitter.com/comedyhereoften | @comedyhereoften\n\nFunk Game Loop by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",

The physician faces an ethical dilemma that puts her clinical judgment up against the amoral ambition of the chair of the graduate school of neuroscience.

After weeks of research, a malfunction during the return launch forces Lilian to choose between survival and completing the mission. \n\n\"Nine Minutes\" by Ernie Gilbert\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm\n\nDirector's Statement:\n\"I wrote and directed Nine Minutes from a simple idea I had. What if you knew you had only a handful of minutes left. What would you do? What would you reflect on? From there, I knew I wanted a grand scale and scope but to tell an intimate story. I landed on a solo astronaut explorer, Lilian. Intense and enthusiastic about her work. Stubborn to the end. She has to choose between her work and her own survival. The short developed into an allegory for my own feelings about leaving NC to move to LA to follow my career ambitions and what that means leaving behind. What relationships I lost, what time apart from family, and ultimately what that made me feel.\" - Ernie Gilbert\n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

      "description": "After her brother is fatally wounded, a naïve but ambitious scavenger, must learn to shoot down a futuristic military drone while avoiding a vicious group of hunters, in order to obtain life saving antibiotics before her brother succumbs to infection. \n\n\"Ikarus\" by Shaun Escayg\n\nConnect with the Filmmakers: \nhttps://www.instagram.com/shaun_escayg/\nhttps://twitter.com/shaunescayg\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sebescayg\n\nMore About \"Ikarus\":\nTeenage scavengers, Queen and her older brother, Birdie, are on their usual hustle of hunting down cargo drones. However, unbeknownst to Birdie, Queen has navigated the pair onto new paths, with the hopes of landing the ultimate payload, Nano-biotics. Queen’s plans go awry when her home-made honing device accidentally sounds, attracting unwanted attention. The siblings narrowly escape capture but, during the chaos, Birdie is shot in the stomach. With Birdie unconscious and consumed by a high fever, Queen must now attempt to hunt these very Nano-biotics on her own, if she’s to save her brother’s life.\n\n\"Ikarus\" Credits:\nShaun Escayg - Writer and Director\nAnnabella Escayg - Executive Producer\nTeri-Leigh Bovell - Line Producer\nOliver Milne - Director Of Photography\nShane Hosein- 1st Ad\nCarly Coutts- Coordinating Producer\nLori Antoinette - Production Designer\nShannon Cockburn - Makeup/Special Effects\nAlex Blecher- Composer\nJeremy Rogers- Supervising Sound Designer\nJamir Blanco- Cg Supervisor\nChris Ilvento- Animator\nMatt Tovar- Animator\nVisual Effects- ILM \nJeff White - Visual Effects Supervisor \nKatherine Farrar Bluff- Visual Effect Producer\n\nCast\nNida Khurshid - Queen\nStephen Hadeed- Birdie\nPricilla Chung - Control\nGervais Aleong- Main Shark\n\nSubscribe to the DUST Newsletter: http://eepurl.com/gnTIbD\nSubscribe to DUST on YouTube: http://bit.ly/2aqc5vh\n\n#DUST #scifi #shortfilm \n\nAbout DUST:\nDUST presents thought-provoking science fiction content, exploring the future of humanity through the lens of science and technology.

      "description": "Enjoy this dramatic short film...When a rock falls and traps his parents inside a burning car, a 7-year-old boy must find the hero within him in order to save their lives...\n\nCredits:\nWriter / Director: Jeremy Haccoun\nStars: Aidan Flynn, Jolene Kay, Michael Dane\nCinematography by Sergio Arguello\nMusic by Siddhartha Barnhoorn\nProduced by Violetta Ekpe\n\nDirector\"s note: \"Beyond\" was shot on Red Epic, in Los Angeles, and in the Mojave Desert. Ever since I started directing, I’ve been wanting to create an intense, epic action sequence - not just spectacle, but a scene where characters we care about do extraordinary things to overcome hopeless situations. The story of this little boy brings together all the things I love about filmmaking - action, suspense, tears, hope, and heroism. The goal was to create something unusually epic for a short and offer the audience 10 minutes fresh out of a Hollywood blockbuster.

Jeremy fed himself with old classics first, then with the many adventure and fantasy films of the early Spielberg era. At the age of 10, he fell in love with Raiders of the Lost Ark. From then on, he has only one thing in mind: make movies. Jeremy made his first short at 11, a 40’ fantasy film shot in VHS. Followed dozens of ambitious shorts among which Alchemy, an adventure epic, and The Battery, a 1’ chain reaction that won a few awards before getting a national release in French theaters.\n\nJeremy started directing professionally on commercial shoots. After his debut spot for Swatch won an award in Cannes, he went on to direct his first TV spot at age 21 and landed his first million-dollar budget at age 24. He kept shooting commercials worldwide for clients such as Xbox, Coors or Disney, gaining experience of large-scale shoots and FX heavy post-productions. Recent spots include a movie-like campaign starring Leonardo DiCaprio and a Spikes Award winner for Subaru Interactive. His previous fantasy short film Paradox earned him many awards including Best Short, Best Screenplay, got selected at Tribeca and a dozen other festivals around the world. He lives in Los Angeles.\n\n————————————————————\nWHO EXACTLY ARE THECGBROS? - https://bit.ly/2IGhYXC\n\n————————————————————\n\nThanks for SUBSCRIBING -http://bit.ly/2c8Fl8u\n\n\nWeb - TheCGBros http://www.thecgbros.com\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCGBro\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/TheCGBro\nTwitter https://twitter.com/TheCGBros\nGoogle+ https://plus.google.com/104301021746334584641\nPinterest https://www.pinterest.com/TheCGBros/\nTumblr http://thecgbros.tumblr.com/\n\n————————————————————\nSpecial Thank\"s to formaDISSENY for making our logo intro animation!! http://www.formadisseny.com/en/\n————————————————————\n————————————————————\n\nIf you’re a CGI ARTIST, ANIMATOR, FILM MAKER or STUDIO and would like your project showcased on our TheCGBros please visit http://bit.ly/2byguiS\n\n————————————————————\n\nTheCGBros have permission to broadcast this video and or it is part of Creative Commons the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b....

      "description": "A couple reconsiders.\n\n\nLong-term couple Kate and Leigh navigates a recent rocky patch in their relationship, but as still-lingering conflicts and resentments begin to surface, they find themselves facing a crucial juncture and confronting just how intertwined their lives have become.\n\nDirector Joey Ally has crafted a compact relationship drama that adeptly captures the texture, tones and rhythms of a long-standing intimate relationship with an unerring and entertaining sense of authenticity, humor and honesty.\n\nThe couple at the center of the drama is gay, but the film's strength is both how it captures both the specificity and universality of identity. The well-written script never shies away from their sexuality, capturing through a situation that most people can relate to in some way. The need to feel seen, heard and understood by someone close to you is a universal desire -- and a journey that many people, no matter where they stand in the continuum of human sexuality,  have some trouble traversing.\n\nThe camerawork is intimate and agile, capturing the excellent performances by Hannah Pearl Utt and Jen Tullock, who portray both the points of tension that have built up between two people but also the investment and love they have for one another. Watching them wrangle, banter and try to understand one another offers both a sense that human relationships can be tricky for anyone -- but the reward is both well worth it and necessary.\n\nA hit at Sundance, PARTNERS may run only seven minutes, but it possesses an emotional intelligence that has an impact well beyond its conclusion. Hugely entertaining and wonderfully warm-hearted, it offers a funny, lovely window into one rich moment in a couple's life together, in a way that many can understand and relate to.\n\n\nPARTNERS.

      "description": "The Vietnam War began in good faith, by good people with good intentions. But a combination of American overconfidence, Cold War tensions and imperialist tendencies the Americans had previously fought so hard against, made the war in Vietnam one of America’s darkest pages in its short but dense history. By the end of the war, more than 58,000 Americans would die, as too would 250,000 South Vietnamese soldiers. Over 1 million North Vietnamese soldiers and Viet Cong guerillas would also perish as well as over 2 million civilians’ from both the north and the south, and thousands more from Laos and Cambodia. \n\nGet a Huge Discount on NordVPN’s Ultimate Security Package Here ➼ https://nordvpn.com/thelifeguide  It's risk-free with Nord's 30-day money-back guarantee! \n\nThe Vietnam War brought everything into question. The rationalization of destroying villages in order to save them. America’s morality in the face of My Lai. The meaning of free-fire zones, shooting anything that moved as soldiers placed a cheapness on the lives of civilians.  The falsification of body counts to increase kill death ratios. The unimportance of battle as men charged up hills because their generals told them too and after losing one platoon or two platoons they marched away to leave the hill for the enemy.  Pride allowed the most unimportant battles to be blown into extravaganzas because America couldn't lose, and she couldn't retreat and because it didn't matter how many lives were lost to prove that point. \n\nTime Stamps 📽\n\nIntroduction 0:00 \nFrench Colonial Rule 1:32\nDien Bien Phu 5:30\nA New Nation 6:42\nJFK 7:55\nOperation Rolling Thunder 10:35\nInto The Jungle 13:45\nThe Tet Offensive 16:31\nTrust is Broken 18:27\nRichard Nixon 19:40\nVietnamization 21:38 \nThings Fall Apart 23:19\nThe Fall of Saigon 24:46\nThe Vietnam War 26:02\nEpilogue 27:14\n\nAll the information in this video came from the 10-part television series \"The Vietnam War\" by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick. \n\nEnding song: https://artlist.io/artist/166/red-meadow\n\nOther Videos: \n\nApollo 11 - The Moon Landing Explained | Best Space Race Documentary:\r  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUh3P3ivNbE \n\nNikola Tesla Explained In 16 Minutes | Nikola Tesla Documentary\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8JDXSYw1U\n\nSun Tzu - The Art of War Explained In 5 Minutes \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz4FNBj1APA&t\n\nThe Fall of Rome Explained In 13 Minutes\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJz15Y6hKMM\n\nNorse Mythology Explained In 15 Minutes\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oxzmJPoRu8&t \n\nLeft vs Right: Political Spectrum - Explained In 4 Minutes \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlQ5fGECmsA\n\nGenghis Khan and The Mongol Empire Explained In 8 Minutes: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDyece8CQF8&t\n\nGreek Gods Explained In 12 Minutes:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri-AoKE42rw&t\n\nFall of The Soviet Union Explained In 5 Minutes:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M16RMXZDG_g&t\n\nWorld War 2 Explained | Best WW2 Documentary | Part 1:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLHPLWDyHio\n\nThe Vietnam War Explained In 25 Minutes | Vietnam War Documentary:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tNTh6KlXXU \n\nEgyptian Gods Explained In 13 Minutes:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bURNgGA2lzM&t\n\nMUSIC AND VIDEO:\n\nIntro and Outro Music by:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ryantothec\n\nIntro Stock footage by:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Beachfro...\n\nVideo music by:\nhttps://artlist.io/\n\nThe Life Guide is a channel dedicated to providing interesting and educational content about a range of political, philosophical, economic and historical topics.

They reflect on their experiences with candor and insight while capturing vibrant colors and cultural life with sincerity and appreciation.\n\nThe viewer joins the three travelers for a first-hand immersion in traditional art making in Native communities, the celebration of skill and beauty, and the power of connecting to one's cultural roots.",
